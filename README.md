# Building Administration System

This project implements a building administration system for managing apartments and residents. It was created as a 2nd semester exam project along with my team members Aqil, Georgi, and Rasmus.

## About
The system allows administrators and residents to manage information related to apartments, residents, and building maintenance. Key features include:

- Resident management: Add, edit, delete resident profiles
- Apartment management: Add, edit, delete apartment details 
- Maintenance/issue reporting: Report and track issues like downpipe problems
- Board member management: Manage building board members

The system has an admin interface for board members and a resident interface. It uses a SQL database to store data. The frontend is built as a Universal Windows Platform app using XAML, C#, and MVVM pattern. The backend exposes a Web API for database operations.

## Project Documentation

The project report provides details on:

- Inception phase: Requirements analysis, use cases, domain modeling
- Elaboration phase: Database design, UI prototypes, class diagrams, sequence diagrams
- Implementation phase: Database creation, API implementation, MVVM frontend
